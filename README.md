# Andrew Weisbeck's Personal Blog - Created with JamStack

These are the starting files used by [Kevin Powell](https://kevinpowell.co) to create a personal blog site for the [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/) DevProjects Challenge, [Create a fast and secure blog using JAMStack](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/create-a-fast-and-secure-blog-using-jamstack-c93coupnxb). You are free to use them however you want to get started with the challenge, if you'd like to start working on creating the site without worrying about the content itself.

I still am changing around my own code to make it my own style. This project is great to get your blog up and running while also learning an awesome stack that is super easy to build and deploy quickly. This is my first JamStack project and it was a lot of fun. 

## DevProjects Challenge

As mentioned, these files are here to help get started with a DevProjects challenge. Please visit the [challenge page](#) to learn more about the challenge.

## Tutorial

You can [watch this video](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) to see how Kevin uses Eleventy, Netlify, and Netlify CMS to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files.
