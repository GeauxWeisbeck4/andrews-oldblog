## Good Life, Bad Life  

**Good Life**: UNC is up 30 points with about 12 minutes to go in the game, leaving Baylor to the largest deficit in NCAA history to overcome - nah, not gonna happen.

**Bad Life:** UNC's top scorer who is on fire is ejected for the game because his elbow accidentally hit a player who pushed off on him.

**Good Life:** Right after this happened I made a really good sandwich.

**Bad Life:** Refs continuously call UNC for insanely stupid fouls while ignoring Baylor basically intentionally fouling UNC to the end of the game and Baylor sends game into overtime. I throw sandwich at the wall in disgust.

**Good Life:** UNC overcomes all odds (and referees) and pulls away to clinch a spot in the Sweet 16 in in Hubert Davis's first year as head coach and UNC can still prove me right by picking them to win it all -

### Why do I always look so stupid and sound so dumb on YouTube?

Ok, not really - but making YouTube tutorial videos is very hard. I am on like my third recording attempt right now. It takes a lot of vulnerability to open up and be yourself when you have to go back and review and edit everything before releasing it. 

I don't know why it's so hard to have vulnerability like that - I could be way more productive if I just didn't GAF and recorded what I'm trying to do. But half the time I get frozen staring at myself while talking because I'm critiquing myself trying to critique my own code while trying to also teach it to everyone. Not a good combination. 

I'm just going to have to post it tomorrow. I promise to do that with the power bestowed on me by being the owner of this blog. Check back tomorrow to see what happens!
