### And as I write this, number 2 seeded Kentucky is about to go down to number 15 Saint Peter's - I love March Madness

This Thursday is the best day of the year every year (well except when COVID cancelled everything, which really sucked considering I had tickets for two weekends). Kentucky just got taken out by number 15 Saint Peter's - the tournament has arrived. The morning was exciting, but there wasn't too much magic until now. There is nothing better than watching the little guys take down the big guys.

I always do feel really bad for the high seeded teams who have a senior superstar or an older team. The tournament is so awesome because of the sheer randomness of the insanity. Who would have though Loyola-Chicago would have been the first ever 16 seed to upset a one seed? In one of my brackets, I picked them as a 10 seed to go to the final four. Go Golden Retrievers.

### As for my Full Stack March Madness - it's coming along!

So for my first day of working on my tech stack apps for the March Madness I - **I.... *I really didn't get shit done - because I spent all day fighting some stupid evil force that pulled out every error in the \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* books to keep me from downloading this Softcover app, which I have spend at least 5 hours trying to figure out now.*** I just want to be able to publish my own E-books :( Linux, MacOS, and Windows all failed at downloading an app that seems to work for everyone else who tried.

I won't reveal too much more because I have my sketched out plans for the first matchup. Just know it is going to be cool if you like web development! And possibly still cool, even if you don't!

### Subscribe to my newsletter, share my content... Please!

So I'm not going to lie- it's been rough being on another stretch of 3+ months of unemployment. I've been doing everything within my power to try and get a job as well as get my freelance web development business off the ground as that takes time. It is becoming a major struggle - very much so financially - but also I'm starting to feel the struggle mentally. I haven't had hardly any eyes on my work, and it's very discouraging. 

But I try to remain an optimist and keep going at it - I'm not giving up my development career, so I'll just be here looking for a job and freelance clients until I turn into a human skeleton. I really could use any help - money would be super duper helpful as that is a very huge stress right now (our big tax return has been delayed 40 days for no reason) but I understand that's asking a lot.

It's actually just as valuable if you share my content, like [my newsletter](https://geauxweisbeck4.substack.com/) and this blog. I also put projects out on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeauxWeisbeck4) a lot. Sharing my stuff with your network helps me have the chance to be contacted about a job or getting my next client.

I do have some exciting content that I will be able to make money off of because it is going to be valuable. Tutorials, E-books, live coding, and I am starting on my first course. But the Full Stack March Madness will produce a lot of really cool tutorials for different tech stacks and apps, so I will see how I put all that together.

I'm rambling now and need to get to coding so I can tell you about all the awesome Full Stack tools that I used to create apps. See y'all Friday!
