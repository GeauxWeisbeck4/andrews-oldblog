# IF WE DON'T WASH ONE FUCKING WINDOW - JUST PLEASE GOD, NO, PLEASE JUST ONCE

So it's been a really fucked up last few years. Wow - it's even more horrifying every time I think I've made peace with how Covid has made life seem unreal. So fucked up that like I can't even believe I am still alive, or how the fuck am I not at least SOMEWHAT WELL OFF BY NOW! I don't know what it is in life - is there some intricate force that always has to fucking stop me before reaching even small, minor, happy goals? Is there ever going to be another moment of stability? 

It really does feel like that I will never truly know any kind of peace in my life again. Ever since, hmmm after a certain time, right after college, life just headed down a one way path to shit. And I don't know if it finally like couldn't keep going against me, because I feel like I finally have the most fail-proof way for me and Lisa to finally get some cash flow going again for the first time since I had a cybersecurity job. A job that I got fired over my mental health.

## Lisa and I Are Going To Launch A Window Washing Business

Yep and it better be fucking successful - I don't know how it could fucking fail. We put literally all of our last dollars into this shit with complete faith that it will succeed. I believe it 100% will succeed - it was a great idea by Lisa and it is something that needs to be done around here and I haven't seen no one doing it. If people are out doing it, I will have to out do them with my marketing, website stuff, and quality of work that Lisa and I do on the houses we get. I have a feeling that we will get at least one of the houses and make like $100. Haha, nah we're going to do much better than you know. 

I will update on future posts - I need to get updating [dailyprojects.dev](https://dailyprojects.dev) - it needs styled and updated with content as well. So at around 6:30 AM, Lisa and I will take all of our door hangers/flyers and we're going to pomp them on every mother-f\*&#^\*# door that we see. We'll then come home, take a brief rest - I will go to my job interview at Julio Ceasers, while my phone is blowing up the entire time with all these people begging for us to come wash their window, because they love the site and flyers so damn much - YEAH!

Until later my friends.
