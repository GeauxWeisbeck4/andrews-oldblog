# IF WE DON'T WASH ONE FUCKING WINDOW - JUST PLEASE GOD, NO, PLEASE JUST ONCE

So it's been a really fucked up last few years. Wow - it's even more horrifying every time I think I've made peace with how Covid has made life seem unreal. So fucked up that like I can't even believe I am still alive, or how the fuck am I not at least SOMEWHAT WELL OFF BY NOW! I don't know what it is in life - is there some intricate force that always has to fucking stop me before reaching even small, minor, happy goals? Is there ever going to be another moment of stability? 

It really does feel like that I will never truly know any kind of peace in my life again. Ever since, hmmm after a certain time, right after college, life just headed down a one way path to shit. And I don't know if it finally like couldn't keep going against me, because I feel like I finally have the most fail-proof way for me and Lisa to finally get some cash flow going again for the first time since I had a cybersecurity job. A job that I got fired over my mental health.
