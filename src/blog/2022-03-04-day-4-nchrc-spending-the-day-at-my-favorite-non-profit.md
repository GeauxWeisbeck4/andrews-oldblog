## North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition: Fighting the Opioid Epidemic

Today really wasn't about being productive on projects or anything. Today was about giving my time to an important cause and helping support my partner. To be honest, I was frustrated about an hour ago because I sat down to work on getting my Python projects on my website so I can show off my knowledge to potential employers and get a much needed job. There's just a certain amount of guilt I feel when Lisa goes to her second job, after her full-time job because I haven't had a job in three months and I don't think the IRS will send our tax returns until 2025. I've been trying but I've just been on a major slump and learning Full Stack Development.

But volunteering at the NCHRC made me feel so much better about myself - I finally got out of the apartment for a day and I got to donate my time to an organization that saves lives and provides resources to individuals afflicted with drug addiction and homelessness. The [North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition](https://www.nchrc.org/) is my favorite non-profit because they treat people with drug addictions with dignity and respect and save so many lives everyday. Participants can get as many free opioid overdose kits as you need, get clean supplies for using drugs (the theory is if you are going to use, you might as well use safely), and even get other necessities like food, donated clothes, and a bunch of fun random stuff that they get.

If you look at their website, I actually redesigned it last to what you see now. No, I'm not super impressed because I used a web editor - I would love another go at doing it from scratch. But this organization really is on the front lines of the opioid epidemic. Lisa is either at the office handing out supplies or going out onto the streets and giving them to users to stay safe. The beautiful thing about it is that the harm reduction workers treat all of the participants with a level of dignity and respect that you just don't see given to drug users who live on the street. It's a place that they can go to and know that they won't be judged for their drug use while also picking up supplies that could save their life. One out of every three Opiate Overdose Rescue Kits that they supply will be used to save somebody's life from an overdose.

That's why Lisa is my hero, because she does this day in and day out. She selflessly chose to spend her career helping others that many people have abandoned. To me, that's more impressive than any website or app that I will ever design. So getting to go in and give my day to help out where it is needed helped me be 100% ok with not sitting on my ass and working on the computer all day.  I'll pick back up tomorrow after a good nights sleep.
