description: I've finally created a fully functional blog app so I can share my daily updates on my web development career. I will eventually have to go backwards from Day 1 to catch up for all the stuff I've done up to today - hah!

After I lost my Cybersecurity job a few days before Thanksgiving, I decided to go all in on learning full stack development. I had been getting more interested into the creation of web app products, much more than just the SOC Analyst job I had where I just stared at Malwarebytes all day and watched for alerts and warnings. It did allow me to learn a lot - and got me deeper into web development.

I've always loved technology and the internet. I really don't know why I didn't go into computer science in college. It was probably because I always felt like a dumbass in highschool because of my ADHD and lack of interest in deciding what I wanted to do with my life at 18. My life would probably be quite different had I found my passion for creating digital products at that age, but I wouldn't change a thing in my life. Not all the failures and hardships - not for a thing. I have gone through so many ups and downs through my life, I look like a 9.0 Richter Scale seismic wave on a sesimograph in the epicenter of an earthquake.

I have learned a lot over the last year - I learned a lot in the past 10 years of life, but I mean in the last year I learned a lot about computer science. I took two self paced bootcamps and tossed in my own education style of using 8,000 different resources to make sure I completely understand something. Yes, I use walkthroughs, templates, and guides, but I like to have my own creative touch on everything I do. I do have to give credit to Kevin Powell's Jamstack blog website video which I will link here when i set up the markdown.

But this blog was created to show off all my projects and what I have learned. There is a lot of stuff I have already done and have extensive notes on, and I will have to create like an archive blog for those posts. But each day I'm trying something new and exciting and trying to profit off of my new skills by either getting a full-time job with a cool company or making money my own way, freelancing and starting up lots of businesses.

I encourage you to follow me on my journey and learn more about entrepreneurship, business, IT, web development, and really life in general. When I say I've encountered a lot in my life, I really mean that. I'm an authentic and honest dude - those are my two most coveted personal values that I try to take with me in everything I do in life. I'm not going to create some bullshit to try and sell you to make money. I provide a service that is based on trust, communication, and open-mindedness.  If your an authentic entrepreneur, business that needs help, or just want any help in general, reach out to me. 

I hope you enjoy reading this blog as much as I enjoy creating it. My newsletter will go out weekly with updates from the week - oh, which reminds me - one of my business ideas is to create a Mean Stack Developer Newsletter and you can follow it on SubStack here. Thank you and I look forward to sharing my adventures with y'all!
