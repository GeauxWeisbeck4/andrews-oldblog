It may seem like I disappeared after blogging for five consecutive days, then going AWOL since then. Even after I promised the Full Stack March Madness. Well the Full Stack March Madness is still going on and you can visit it [on my substack page](https://geauxweisbeck4.substack.com/) currently. I also didn't go anywhere at all!

### Why didn't I blog or anything at all?

I woke up one of those mornings after writing my last newsletter and felt just awful - I felt depressed as I still haven't seemed to find a job, land a freelance gig, or anything else really as a developer yet and there are bills to pay, plus things I still need to pay for myself for my business. On top of that, I had the TV on which showed the devastation of the Russian Infestation of Ukraine. I was so angry, desperate, and sad that I felt helpless watching new breaking news panels show "Ukraine Nuclear Plant almost blown up" or "Bomb hits a residential intersection and kills dozens". 

One morning, the news showed that a maternity hospital had been bombed. That wasn't the last straw, but that was one where I just bawled my eyes out, wondering who the fuck would allow people to do this shit. I was mad our government wasn't doing enough - I was really mad I wasn't doing anything. Dropping my life and going to fight as a soldier is out of the question. But I had seen news of the Anonymous Group hacking Russia and they had this sick video to Vladimir Putin about the Cyberwar their group is unleashing on his government.

This video inspired me to seek out what ways I could help out - legally! Of course.

### You can help too - but be careful

I joined a group called "IT Army of Ukraine" which has a Telegram channel that hands out tasks for people to complete that help Ukraine - whether it's DDOS attacks or posting real news about what is actually going on in Russian Business Google Reviews, everything that anyone can do helps. You can read about the group and [how to help here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/volunteer-hackers-fight-russia).

Now if you are going to go participate, I would recommend using Tor, a VPN, and making sure the network you are operating on is separate from all of your personal and business files and machines. You can open yourself up to viruses and more. That is why I was gone for multiple days from any developing or creating content that I published - I needed to maintain anonymity and full access to help out where I can.

Remember that hacking is illegal and there is not necessarily any protection if you do partake in illegal action. I didn't and I was still able to do a lot to help out the group. You can also help out Ukraine in many other ways. 

### Continuing to help and getting back to work

I am going to find some kind of way to get help to the Ukrainians in other ways. One idea I have is to create care packages for the refugees. Another is to sell camping gear and use most of the proceeds to purchase gear and MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) for the Ukrainian Army. 

As for other work, I am focusing on my freelance business as well as my Full Stack March Madness 2022 event, presented by the MEANStack Developer Newsletter. You won't want to miss out on these reviews and tutorials! I will be packaging some of the content up for sale as there will be tutorials and other awesome content. Check it out!
