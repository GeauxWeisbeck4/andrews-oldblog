## Whenever inspiration hits…

Do you ever think to yourself (while doing something awesome outside in beautiful weather), “I would love to write about this.” Well now you can!

My Jamstack Blog will get you up and going right away and you’ll be able to blog whatever, whenever you want - providing internet is available (I’m working on an app for that though). It’s so cool, I just made the title of this blog post exactly what I’m doing right now and WAM - I have my content for the day.

### Let me build your next personal blog

Contact me at Andrew.weisbeck@gmail.Com if you want me to build your dream personal blog! I am offering a low starting price of $19.99 for now with a $6.99 ongoing subscription for your service - but wait there’s more! For 3 months, you’ll get free blogging! That’s because I’m building a mobile app and more features, and I’d hate for anyone to pay full price for something that’s not completely finished yet.

$19.99 + sales tax is all it costs for your next blog! Contact me today!

\*Note - custom domain names are extra, but I will help set that up at no cost to you other than you purchasing the domain name which I’ll include in the price!
