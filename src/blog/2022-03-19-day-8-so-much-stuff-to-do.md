imageAlt: I read so many books today
---
## Friday Night - Raleigh, NC - 9:29 PM 

I just finished reading my fourth dev book of the day, *Hugo In Action: Static sites and dynamic Jamstack apps* by Atishay Jain. I also have gotten very little done and I'm feeling Friday Night panic mode. Time as whizzed by today and I planned on pumping out 4-5 websites tonight. I know that's stupid crazy right?

This one was longer than the other Jamstack book, but I'm not sure if it was shorter than my book on the MERN Stack or Headless eCommerce frameworks. 95% of people would probably rather carve their eyes out than spend like 12 hours researching and reading about Serverless Jamstack apps or about React.js, Gatsby, and Hugo. I will say, I do love the pictures that come out of the Manning series books (*see below*):

I am not sure what the lady represents but she is very beautiful with her traditional Japanese outfit I guess. Maybe she is supposed to be from the past? I don't think she wrote the Hugo framework, but I really don't know who did so who knows, ya'know? But if the Hugo In Action book cover doesn't make sense, than the cover for CSS in Depth really doesn't make any sense (*once again, I present random dev language book cover*):

![CSS-in-Depth](/assets/blog/cssbook.png "This book is a classic for learning CSS... in depth.....")

The Pilgrim women really is out of place in this picture because she really has nothing to do with CSS at all! Well, she was actually probably designed with CSS - and it's possible she could be Amish or maybe there are still Puritans in the United States and they know how to code sick CSS layouts.

### Yeah I know I sound crazy - but there's a purpose behind my rambling

Well not really that much of a purpose behind my rambling. I mostly just couldn't look at these book covers anymore without mentioning the randomness of the characters that are very well drawn, but just out of place. I mean, they look really cool and it works for me as a cool cover, but it's just so random and it bothers me I have no idea why these cartoon characters were chosen to represent development frameworks and languages.

> ### But now look at this next book cover:

![rust in action](/assets/blog/rustbook.png "This young lad fits in a little bit more as he looks to beat some ass")

Now this one kind of works - this young lad has his paws up and gloved, ready to get in on the action. And his name might be Rust, just like the programming language. But hold up - I'm about to completely take back any kind of common sense on why these people are on the cover of these Manning series books - look at this one.....

![ go in action](/assets/blog/gobook.png "Ok, yeah no idea what's going on here...")

Ok what the hell. A Native American looking at an arrow. Yeah these book covers make no sense and I just wasted a bunch of time talking about them. 

But ok, there is a purpose behind all the studying today...

### The Full Stack March Madness 2022 is underway!

So I haven't generated much buzz about my own little event I announced. I kind of screwed myself on generating hype, but wouldn't take back those days. But I don't know how many people are reading this yet so, whatever! Fuck it - I'll stop swearing once people complain at me for being an unprofessional blogger.

But I basically have been reading and practicing commands all day because I am about to create a tutorial video to complement an Ebook and other content for a course I'm making, and I'm really nervous about getting it right... not really but I just hate looking stupid. The Russian Trolls will have a hay day with me if I can't even run a full stack app tutorial video.

But the bigger news is that I have like 4 or 5 sites about to deploy for my business brands and one of them is the MEANStack Developer Website! That is why there is no newsletter yet - it's been a long day. Oh well, it can be released later after I create the cool content.

Then I am 100% back on track, every single Friday and Monday, pinky swear.

### Be on the lookout for merch and other things for sale

I have also been non-stop working on getting stuff up on the internet that I can sell, because I haven't gotten a paycheck in months and it's been really shitty not having any money, ever. I'll have some cool stuff that's not too crazy, but I will have some exclusive content - like a class and ebook I'm working on. I'm also going to start coding live on Twitch and will create a subscription on my channel to show cool dev and IT stuff to you.

**10:12 PM**

This was a nice break from the backbreaking reading and coding lorem ipsum all day, but I really have to go pound through these apps I have to make. I can do it!

Oh and just a little preview for what my next blog will be about...

#### THE O'REILLY DEV SERIES FRONT BOOK COVERS ARE EVEN CRAZIER THAN THE OTHER ONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am completely kidding... I really need to finish these apps and go to bed.
