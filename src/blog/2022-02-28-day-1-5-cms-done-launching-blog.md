# I FINALLY DID IT

I CREATED MY OWN PERSONAL BLOG AND CUSTOM CMS!!!!! It took a while to find the right way to do it I guess, but luckily I discovered [Kevin Powell's CMS JAMStack Blog Project video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wD00RT6d-g) and I put everything together with a nice easy process. Thank you Kevin - you are the man. You also helped me figure out how to create a NAV real easy. Follow Kevin Powell's [Newsletter](https://www.kevinpowell.co/newsletter) or [buy one of his T-shirts](https://teespring.com/stores/making-t...) to support him because this guy is awesome.

Now I need to add it to my personal site and get that setup on Netlify as well - I found my first full stack setup that I truly find convenient. I kept trying to use other setups that were in my Bootcamps and just were taking too long to edit and create stuff so I had to find something else. I used Kevin's starting template, Eleventy, and Netlify & Netlify CMS. This will be my official way of create websites and such for now while I also play around with Python web development.

I'm going to just bring my own content in, edit some of the CSS to make it more like my own blog site. I am going to use the separate domain to keep my personal blog from my other blogs and newsletter projects I create. This blog will also have an email subscription list for newsletters and such. One of my strategies in building a profitable developing career is to create email lists out of every business idea I launch. Market myself through organic traffic like other developers, businesses, and entrepreneurs by doing good development work and sharing in the glory of what we create. 

I want to add my Section4 stuff ASAP so I can integrate all my project stuff and actually show all the behind the scenes research work and design stuff that I did that I didn't show in my project. I mainly had enough time to finish learning what I needed to for web development, during a 2-week sprint, money is low and I need a job, and I had to create my brand (my personal website to follow all my projects and such). I hardly had enough time to get it up on GitHub nonetheless because I wanted to work slowly through creating the HTML and CSS in CodePen. 

I wouldn't have been able to do it without [Wes Bos's ](https://wesbos.com/)*What the FlexBox* course (signup free [](Flexbox.io)at [flexbox.io](Flexbox.io)) - I highly recommend his podcast with [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski) called [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/), especially if you are new to web development like me. They provide outstanding resources and tips - oh and wonderful deals that help you try awesome new tools for free or lovely discounts on the products that you do need as a developer to scale out when you start making money. They truly have been the guiding voices of my development career - they have a lot of HOLD UP DON"T PUBLISH THAT YET moments like my original personal website idea when I could barely get the CSS down, making me take a four day rabbit hole of researching CSS which you can find on my resources page (I'll come back and link this when I update my website :). 

Credit to helping me nail down the basics definitely goes to instructors [Angela Yu ](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)and [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) for their Web Developer Bootcamps on Udemy. I recommend both of these - the reason why is they have two different teaching styles that I believe were important for me to learn quickly on my own time. Angela provides easier to find resources and gets you going on projects quick - she teaches you like the bare bones to really go far. Colt is more in depth - he also makes beautiful visuals that are great for note takers (mine are saved in Evernote). He really can hammer home the concepts and makes it fun to learn. They both get 5.0 from me for the amount of effort, authenticity, and the amount of skill and intellect it takes to create a course of that depth. Thank y'all.

\*Tip: Wait for Udemy to release their deals to purchase the courses. You'll save bigtime.\*

Finally, last but not least, probably one of my favorite teachers ever is [Jen Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jen4web_html-css-activity-6811984276419088384-lqVp/). I was seriously stressed about getting my project out for my Section4 class with everything going on and her nice little [Getting Started with CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-css/) was so great for helping me build a layout for my site that was beautiful, simple, and still challenging with the CSS. She is my favorite teacher I haven't met (yet, she tweeted at me on Twitter!) but made it seem like what would have been a favorite professor or high school teacher walking me through a concept I struggled with so much because of the complexity of the topic. Thank you x1Million Jen!

I've got a lot of stuff to get posting and some applications and interview stuff to get done, so I must make this my last update - for now. Thanks for reading!
