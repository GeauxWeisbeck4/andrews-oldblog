## 3 Months of Non-Stop Learning and Coding Finally Paying Off

When I was let go from work two days before Thanksgiving at the end of 2021, it was absolutely crushing to me and Lisa (my fianc√©). We had just worked our way back out of almost losing our home and finally weren't broke and then BAM - 85% of our income disappeared just like that. 

I was scared and stressed as soon as I lost my job - it had taken me almost 5 months to land that cybersecurity job and now I was broke for the holidays and knew it would be a struggle to find work again. Needless to say, I applied for a couple hundred jobs and even got turned down for a graveyard grocery stocking job 4 times that the store couldn't fill. I was told I was too qualified or I wasn't qualified enough everywhere I applied. I also think getting told no a few hundred times in a year makes it impossible to even accept it if somebody tells you yes. 

I got pissed off enough after I got fired though that I set on my goal with the psychopathic determination of Michael Jordan - I was going to learn Full Stack Development and get a job, no matter what it took. Web Development is what I love to do and I was going to make sure that I could also use my skills to support myself if a time of crisis like the Pandemic happened again. There were maybe 10 days out the last three months where I wasn't at my computer for 18-24 hours a day, cramming in and coding and learning everything I could.

Things started getting better for me when I participated in a [Section4](https://www.section4.com/) innovation sprint (they even gave me a free scholarship <3 ) and met many successful people and finally felt like I had what the skills necessary to get a Full stack Developer job - that was a few weeks ago though.

Not so fast my friend.

Aside from one callback for a full stack developer in training job, it was a whole lot more silence. I began to get upset, desperate and cranky. Luckily I kept my head on right and Lisa kept my heart straight. 

### Ring Ring, Ring Ring.... Hello?

Today after working all night on an app that is actually really cool and I'm super excited about, I finally had some hope. I was crabbing at Lisa for having to walk down to Walgreens to put money on my card that we barely have to pay for her Uber to work when the call came in - and I missed it... initially, haha. I worked out and then came home and saw that I had a voicemail. 

It was a very promising call for a job that I would be perfect for. It pays well and its a company I never thought I would dream of working for. I also think I will get to live in Linux and I will get to primarily use Python if I get the job - my favorite programming language and the one I've known the longest. I won't say where yet because it was just the initial conversation. But it feels right.

I'll take all the victories I can get, no matter how big or small. The last couple years were full of way too many losses and it really ground me to my rock bottom. But I gritted all that bullshit out and have made it out to the other side, so far. 

### The Moral of the Story

Don't ever give up! Man, I literally went through like 600 days of hell and there were so many times where I was just laying on the floor and couldn't do anything because I was so depressed and hopeless. But my better half would pick me up (I'd do the same as well), dust me off and trudge me back on through whatever I was going to face next. 

Things are looking up for me. I'm getting really good at developing cool stuff quickly and I've been working on a lot of cool content stuff and trying to make some money creating websites, but regardless of not making money right now, I absolutely love what I do. I put in probably about as many hours as you could possibly spend alive in front of a computer the last three months and its been awesome, painful, and also tiring. 

If you're going through your hardest days, I'm not going to tell you its going to end soon - I don't even know if my hard times are over, or if they ever will be. The fact is, life can just suck and kick your ass for no reason and it can do it forever if it wants. But I promise, if you pick yourself up every time you get knocked back down to rock bottom that nothing will be able to keep you down and the sky is the limit. 

I feel that my best days are just ahead of me.

\*P.S. - If you are struggling with life, please talk to somebody. It can get easy to bury it down further and further until it turns into something really bad. You don't have to be mentally ill to be depressed and struggle with your emotions, but if you are, there is no shame in mental illness. I have multiple mental illnesses and being aware of that has saved my life.
