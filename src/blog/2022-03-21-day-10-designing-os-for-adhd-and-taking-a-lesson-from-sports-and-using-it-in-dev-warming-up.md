  race - I would run my best times... Is there something there?

# I love that I designed this blog for the easiest possible way for me to write.

Otherwise I would not be posting this many days this consecutively. Setting up your operation station is important for getting the most efficiency and consistent results. Had this been a WordPress content management system which has many distracting features, I would have posted the first three days, then maybe two months later, then maybe a year later... you get the idea. 

Basically, my severe ADHD makes it very difficult to do something like this blog consistently. I have found that I have to design all of my systems to be easily accessible to use at any time and super simple with few features to use. Otherwise I spend all day dicking around with the features and never get content out or work done. 

I love my current CMS or writing station. I really love to write, but find my productivity stifled by systems that have lots of shiny things for me to scatter off to. My current CMS, [the NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is absolutely amazingly easy to set up and use for developers. Here is how beautiful and simple it is - the first picture is my blog writing area and the second is the dashboard when you login.

So simple. The only place to go - is the writing place! No extensions or anything to fuck off with.

And see how simple that all is to just hop on and write and create a blog post every day? I promise you, any other type of system and you would not be reading any of this right now. And of course, yes I can always add features on and will need to in the near future, but this is a good way to get established into a writing habit.

Oh, and the best part? I can create this for you for an affordable price! If you want your own personal blog like this, I will help create one at a very low price, depending on what your looking for, so [check out my work](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev/) and then [give me a shout](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev/contact.html)! And subscribe to my [newsletter and donate](https://geauxweisbeck4.substack.com/) ([and follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GeauxWeisbeck4) - I try to tweet at least once a day and working to do so more) if you want to help a poor web dev out! :)

That's my marketing for the week :)

### Warming up like its 2009 

That was the year I helped Capital High School win its third straight football state championship... oh the fuzzy memories! Getting screamed at by my "alcoholic" (we joked that he was - he very well might be, but I dunno) receiver coach, getting hit in full pads in 10 degree weather after an 8 hour school day that started at 5 AM - yes, THE MEMORIES!!

Anyways, I have been struggling with getting in the flow of work and pounding out what I need to each day. I get distracted easy, get lost, etc. I remember being way more focused and performing my best by running through stupid simple warmups that got the muscles moving. I decided to try that approach to my dev and writing. 

I spent the entire day depressed, lost, and unable to figure out where to start on a long list of things to do. Lisa had the greatest idea ever to treat us to sushi (she's the only earner currently), a break we really needed to give to ourselves. It was delicious and my day got better watching college basketball. I also decided to try a new approach and warmup before I jumped into things. 

That was at 5:00.

At 10:00 I started pounding out some typing exercises and was impressed with my numbers. If you saw the caption to the blog, yes 100 words per minute was broken a few times in over 30 typing exercises. I want to start updating and keeping track of those stats to see how they improve over time and how they effect my productivity over time. 

More to report on that. 

## Back to coding all night and sleeping a couple hours in the morning before getting up and doing it again!

Thanks for reading! Until next time y'all.
