## Turning my college nickname into a business

In 2010, I made the decision to attend the University of Nebraska after having a miserable first year at Montana State University in Bozeman - the reason why is beyond the theme of this article, but it was one of the best decisions I could have made for myself at the time. Well not financially, but the experience was incredible. Honestly, my college degree has done very little for me - I still sit here everyday spending half my day carefully applying to jobs with no results.

I'm trying to at least focus on freelance to try and bring some income in, so I decided to turn another project into a business idea. The best part of the business is that the brand name comes from my college nickname, *Mountain Man*. I can't remember exactly who, but somebody from my fraternity first called me that mostly because I was from Montana, but also partially due to my wild and outgoing nature. But the brand isn't supposed to be symbolic of my college personality anymore - it is representative of the adventurous spirit we all have inside of us.

### MT Man Adventures General Store and Blog

> *You can visit the current website, [mtman.ventures](https://mtman.ventures/) to learn more and check out the business!*

I am currently working on getting my store set up right now and will be drop shipping my products for now. I'll be looking to drop ship outdoor good products, merchandise that I've created, and hopefully partner up or find good deals from suppliers on popular products so I can sell my own stuff once I build some capital. I want it to be like the General Store that you would come up on while traveling the Oregon Trail, only this store is adapted for you while your adventuring the World Wide Web instead. 

The blog is all about adventure, outdoor activity, and our products. But I hope that someday the brand gains enough traction where people will send in their own submissions to be featured. MT Man Adventures blog wants to hear about the time you went camping and came face to face with a grizzly bear! Or simply about how you trudged through snow and sleet to get to your local coffee shop in -10 degree weather so you could sit by a fire place and read.

### Stay Tuned For More!

I'm not sure of the success of this project, but it will be fun to roll out and implement. Designing it helped me fork out a couple other ideas to gain traction as web developer and it also helped me get my first thing done for my Full Stack March Madness ([learn more here](https://geauxweisbeck4.substack.com/p/meanstack-developer-full-stack-march?s=w)).

If you want to share an adventure or something on our blog, just send your story or comments to mtmanadventuresblog@gmail.com and we will publish your story, given it is appropriate.

I have much work to continue doing, so check out the site and stay tuned for more!
