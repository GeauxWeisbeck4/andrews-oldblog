## Who woulda thunk it - THIS GUY!!

Yeah I’m bragging because I picked UNC to win it all. Also how much fun they’ve been to watch this tournament. I can’t remember a more fun NCAA tournament - remember, I went to Nebraska for college and we don’t really play basketball. 

We have a team, yes. But they are really there to take attention off of all the stupid stuff that the football team does in the offseason. The only way you can distract the Children of the Corn from football is by making them believe they’re really good at basketball because we have a coach with a 7-40 record or something here but he’s gonna magically make us really good some year because - you know, we deserve it at Nebraska!

I digress.

I’m just so proud of my local Chapel Hill Rams and happy for Hubert Davis - great job on getting us to the Elite Eight in your first year. \

Geaux Heels!
