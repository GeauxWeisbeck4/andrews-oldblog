## Mardi Gras 2022 - The Day After

I don't celebrate Mardi Gras the way I used to, but I still love buying that beautiful and glittery purple, green, and yellow King Cake because it's delicious. I also love the finding the little baby (aka [**f√®ve**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A8ve) in the cake before I choke on it - I actually almost choked on the King Cake baby some years ago at work during Mardi Gras when I ate a piece of King Cake without actually thinking about it. How ironic would it have been if I had choked to death on the little trinket that is supposed to "King" or "Queen" the person who finds the symbol for luck and prosperity... 

Well this year I was really disappointed because I not only almost forgot about Mardi Gras (thank God I got one of the last two King Cakes at the grocery store) but I also couldn't find the damn baby in my cake. I was sitting by myself at 1 AM, forcing myself to continue eating King Cake while wearing the beads that came with cake so I could find the baby. Eventually I gave up and cursed the company who ruined my chance at luck and prosperity this year.

Fast forward to three PM today - I'm walking into the kitchen to get a piece of left over King Cake and FUCK!!!! I FUCKING STEPPED ON THE GODDAMN BABY!!!! If you've ever experienced stepping on a lego, you can share the pain I felt when I was just trying to get a delicious piece of cake. Maybe the King Cake baby symbolizes something else for me, like stop eating so much King Cake because you sit at a desk all day and will get fat or, maybe you should pay more attention to what you're doing? I don't know, but either way, the baby wins Mardi Gras again this year and I have to be patient to get lucky King Cake baby.

### Spending the day networking

One of the biggest changes I wanted to make as an entrepreneurship was my whole marketing approach. After reading [Russell Brunson's Traffic Secrets](https://trafficsecrets.com/thebook-5), I have changed my who approach to marketing by following his Top 100 approach to discovering your dream customer/audience for content. I haven't been the best at really following through every day as much as I want to because I end up getting so wrapped up in coding projects, but I at least have done enough to start seeing the benefits of the approach. But today I had a great opportunity to network with people and expand my community and it was actually really fun.

Late last night before I headed to bed, I commented on somebody's post who was seeking help. I wasn't thinking about marketing myself at the time and honestly just wanted to help the guy out, but I ended up waking up today with almost a dozen messages in my Facebook inbox. I had so much fun chatting with other entrepreneurs who have the same struggles I've had in the past and some of the same struggles I continue to have. It felt good to reassure people they were doing the right thing in pursuing their dream and being their own boss.

So often I dread doing this and I really don't know why. I love coding, but chatting with other people who love doing the same things as you is like a really good high. I am going to commit to spending at least two hours each day posting in my communities, meeting other entrepreneurs that I can help (or they can help me), and do a more thorough job of tracking results and measuring my strategies impact. 

### Which brings me to...

I also have ADHD and I am easily distracted, lose track of time easily, and quickly can get disorganized if I am not mindful of what I am doing. My Top 100 community marketing is actually very difficult for me because I go down the rabbit hole when I use social media sites. All it takes is clicking on one Facebook Ad for Web Dev software and I'm done for.

I had already planned to a while ago, but I actually took action on this objective today: "Create simple productivity tools to stay focused on coding". I did just that and made myself a Pomodoro Timer in Python! (Pomodoro is Italian for tomato) The idea behind the Pomodoro Timer is that you work for 25:00 intervals, your timer goes off and gives you a five minute break. This is repeated three more times after the first 25 minutes and then then the timer gives you a nice 15-30 minutes break to recuperate.

It is supposed to help stave off mental fatigue and help people like me with ADHD to stay focused on their work. You can use this [Pomodoro Timer](https://pomofocus.io/) online if you want to try it out now! Well the day got away from me and I had to step away from finishing the timer mechanism to get this posted before midnight, but here is the general GUI (Graphical User Interface) for my Pomodoro Timer:

I think that will look super cute when it is all said and done! I plan to incorporate it onto [my website](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev)  when I finish it so y'all can be more "Promoductive" with me! Ok that was stupid - I'm going to finish my project and go to bed now. 

Thank you for reading!
