### Read and Subscribe to My Newsletter!

I don't have much to blog today because I just spent forever creating my newsletter today. An idea came into my head today - since it's March, I thought it would be fun to create a Full Stack March Madness Tournament to decide which tech stack is number one. 

I have a big task in front of me, trying to get people and developers to subscribe to my newsletter and participate in this event. You can do me a huge favor by [subscribing to my newsletter](https://geauxweisbeck4.substack.com/p/the-meanstack-developer-newsletter) and sharing on your social media pages. 

I have a lot of work to do, so that's it for today. I have a weather app and some Kali Linux tutorials I'm working on.
